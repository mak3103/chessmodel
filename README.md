# chessmodel
Solution for the Chess Game Modelization problem.

Our target is to implement a full chess game. However, this is just the first iteration, so we start small :

Given a chessboard of side size “n”, we want to put pieces on the board, starting with a rook (which can move only horizontally or vertically).
Once placed on the chessboard (wherever we want), we can then make the rook move. But of course, it can’t go out of the chessboard, it has to stop on the edges.
Also, the rook can't move from point A to B if there are other pieces on its path.
Implement such a system with the design you feel is best. No additional library can be used, apart from things that would help you to test.

recommendations

Make this a very basic Maven project, and host it on a GitHub public repository
Unit tests are appreciated
There's no single solution for this exercise : the goal is to see the steps you take when building a system. Therefore, we need you to commit very often, after each logical step, so that we can follow your thought process when reviewing what you've done. A single, bulk commit with your final code is clearly not something we are interested in.
Be smart, don't try to cheat ;-) The goal of this simple exercise is to save time for everyone : there's no point asking a friend for inputs on it, and then fail to explain or extend it during the face to face interview.
